  **User View**<br>
  Books and Users are two cores of the library,<br>therefore a great, easy, simple user view would help users to keep the information and their books.<br>

### Separate Views
  Separate views are set for different users: <br>
  * Normal users can only have limited access: Check out, return, read books
  * Librarian can have all the power: Delete, rename, add books

Separate views integrited the software to a completed library.
